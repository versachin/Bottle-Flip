# Bottle-Flip
Bottle Flip Sachin Palta

BIG PICTURE
The game should basically be a window with a background, and a water bottle (preferably Dasani). When you tap the screen the bottle should flip. There should be a  chance of the bottle landing on the bottom vs the bottle on itâ€™s side vs the bottle landing in the cap. Later, maybe we could add a way for a person to move the mouse and drag the bottle around. When the person gets to land it on the bottom, or the cap, they should be awarded with a message of some sort.
